# Mowk Dev Tutorials

Welcome to the official repository for Mowk Dev tutorials! This repository is your go-to resource for the source code of the various tutorials and projects featured on our [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@mowkdev). Our aim is to provide you with comprehensive resources to help you learn and implement various programming concepts and technologies.

## What You'll Find Here

Inside this repository, you will find a structured collection of folders, each dedicated to a specific tutorial or project covered on our YouTube channel. These folders contain the complete source code, additional resources, and sometimes datasets used in the tutorials, allowing you to follow along and experiment on your own.

### Directory Structure

```

Each tutorial/project folder includes:

- `src/`: The source code files.
